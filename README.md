# PDFArchive

This is a little tool to take a directory tree that contains PDF files
(and JPGs and PNGs), and do the following:

* generate thumbnails of the first page of each PDF, or of the image
  file for JPG/PNG
* extract the text from the PDF or image
* create an index page for each directory linking the source file to
  both its thumbnail and extracted text
